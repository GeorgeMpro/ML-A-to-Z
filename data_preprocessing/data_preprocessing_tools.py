#### Data Preprocessing Tools

##### Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

##### Importing the dataset
###
# we create the data frame
dataset = pd.read_csv('Data.csv')
# features - The Columns with which we are going to predict the Dependent Variable
# For this we create the Matrix of Features
x = da
# Dependent Variable Vector - The last column (purchased yes/no)


##### Taking care of missing data

##### Encoding categorical data

###### Encoding the Independent Variable

###### Encoding the Dependent Variable

##### Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set

##### Feature Scaling
